Test Drive is a great way for you to showcase your product to potential customers by giving them the option to 'try before you buy', resulting in increased conversion and the generation of highly qualified leads.

### How does it work? 
A potential customer discovers your application in AppSource, signs in and agree to the terms of use. A pre-configured environment that is set up by you that demonstrates the application's key features and benefits will then be made available for the potential customer to try for a fixed number of hours as configured by you.

No matter how complex your application, the Test Drive framework helps you to bring your product to life and generate highly qualified leads.
